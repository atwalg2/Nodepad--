## __Edmonton Public Library (EPL) Ticket Manager__:

The EPL uses an online ticketing system to report issues to their IT and HR departments. Tickets are created using an email, this system currently doesn’t work because the employee often does not provide all the information needed to resolve their ticket. This is an efficiency issue because there are some employees who work part-time, and may not be easily contacted by IT/HR. The current system has several issues: 
  - it is not intuitive for part-time workers 
  - it is not efficient enough for full-time workers 
  - ticket receivers don’t always get the required information to resolve their ticket
  - there is no way for the client to view their ticket resolution progress 
  - there is no way to look at previously resolved tickets


## __User Requirements__:

* Users must be able to submit tickets to both IT and HR
* Users must be able to edit tickets to add info.
* Users must be able to view their past tickets.
* Users must be able to annotate their ticket for clarification.
* Managers must be able to view the tickets for their entire branch.
* IT/HR should be able to see all tickets for their respective department.
* Managesr must be able to add comments for tickets in their branch.
* The system should be easily accessible for newcomers.
* The system should be streamlined for experienced users.


## __Functional Requirements__:

* The system will support:
   * creating tickets
   * viewing tickets 
   * editing tickets
   * Priority sorting based on the provided matrix
   * Closing/reopening tickets

## __System Features__:
