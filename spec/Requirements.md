Summary:
The Edmonton Public Library (EPL) uses a online ticketing system to report issues to their IT and HR departments.Tickets are created using an email, this system doesn’t work because the employee often does not provide all the information needed to resolve the ticket. This is an efficiency issue because there are some employees who work part-time, and may not be in constant communication with IT/HR. The current system has several issues: it is not intuitive for part-time workers, it is not efficient enough for full-time workers, ticket receivers don’t always get the required information to resolve their ticket, there is no way for the client to view their ticket resolution progress, there is no way to look at previously resolved tickets.
