#Using the Ticketing System
##Logging in
You must have an account to view the content of the system. When you go to the site, you will be promted for a Username and password. Once you have logged in, you will be brought to the main page
##Main Page
The Main page will show a simplified version of the different tabs in the bar. Recenet announcements will be shown at the top to inform any Employees of current issues (ie Internet outtage at a certain branch). In separate tables, the user will also see a list of both personal and branch tickets, starting from the most recent. If the ticket is open, it will show submission date, otherwise it will show closed. Beneath those will be the Frequently Asked Questions, which will potentially help users solve common issues, keeping IT resources free for other problems.
##My Ticket Page
This is the main ticketing page, which will show a list of personal tickets that the employee has sent in. It will show the date of submission as well as the status of the ticket. There will be a button where the user can submit a new ticket, or edit an existing one.
##Branch Ticket Page
This page works the same as the afforementioned My Tickets Page, but the user can view any ticket that they are authorized to see from their entire branch.
##Ticket Submission Page
This page is where a user will submit a ticket. The imperative information for IT/HR will be required so there is no need to follow up. The tickets will be separated into categories, so that we can reduce confusion amongst employees
##Announcements
This page will show the Announcements from IT, it can inform users of large problems, or give friendly reminders to employees
