#Using the Ticketing System
##Logging in
You must have an account to view the content of the system. When you go to the site, you will be promted for a Username and password. Once you have logged in, you will be brought to the main page
##Main Page
The Main page will show a simplified version of the different tabs in the bar. Recenet announcements will be shown at the top to inform any Employees of current issues (ie Internet outtage at a certain branch). In separate tables, the user will also see a list of both personal and branch tickets, starting from the most recent. If the ticket is open, it will show submission date, otherwise it will show closed. Beneath those will be the Frequently Asked Questions, which will potentially help users solve common issues, keeping IT resources free for other problems.
##My Ticket Page
This is the main ticketing page, which will show a list of personal tickets that the employee has sent in. It will show the date of submission, and they will be separated by status in different tabs. There will be a button where the user can submit a new ticket, or edit an existing one.
##Branch Ticket Page
This page works the same as the afforementioned My Tickets Page, but the user can view any ticket that they are authorized to see from their entire branch.
##Ticket Submission Page
This page is where a user will submit a ticket. The imperative information for IT/HR will be required so there is no need to follow up. The tickets will be separated into categories, so that we can reduce confusion amongst employees. Before tickets are submitted, the user will see a page that confirms info.
##IT Ticket pages
This will be the page that IT employees see. The tabs will have Tickets that IT may submit, they have a list of open and close tickets and they will viewed by priority. IT will be able to search for a tickey by keyword, and sort by priority. The closed tickets page will have an option to view the IT solution.
##Announcements
This page will show the Announcements from IT, it can inform users of large problems, or give friendly reminders to employees
##Help
Help will have a section of frequently asked questions that some of the clients may have come accross, this helps to avoid having IT members repeatedly helping users with some easily fixed problems, these could be written and added by the IT staff.
